# Introduction

Exploratory and manual functional testing are both human-based testing techniques where tests are performed by people rather than automated by software. The key difference between the two though is that manual functional testing follows a structured plan while exploratory testing is done by the tester playing around with software and testing realistic scenarios. As a result, exploratory testing gives the tester significantly more creativity and freedom rather than restricting them. This does lead to some limitations though, as exploratory testing may not always be ideal for large software as it can be difficult to track which functionalities have been tested and which ones haven’t. When it comes to manual function testing, the key difference is that tests are written first, and are performed by the same or another person at another time, while with exploratory testing, tests are performed right after they are thought of. Manual functional testing allows us to do the same tests each time and test functionality that is known to cause issues across versions.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We are planning to test the functionality of the system as a whole first to see what the program does, then if we counter small defects or bugs, we test those specific functions more extensively. First we are going to try to login incorrectly and then see the messages the program outputs, after that we are going to login correctly and go to the next phase of the program. The next phase is to choose what type of transaction we want to do, we will choose each transaction and try to test different numbers and different combinations in order to thoroughly test the system and right before we are done we will check the status log to check if every test we did got updated correctly.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

From a benefits perspective, exploratory testing allows for more flexibility and creativity in the testing process, as the tester is free to explore the software in any way they see fit. However, you may miss some bugs/defects that may have been missed by a predetermined script. Manual scripted testing, on the other hand, provides a clear and repeatable testing process, which can be useful for ensuring that all necessary tests are performed and for measuring the effectiveness of the testing process over time.

From a trade-offs perspective, exploratory testing may take a little bit longer and be less efficient than manual scripted testing, as the tester may need to spend more time exploring the software to find defects. Manual scripted testing could be more efficient, but may also miss defects that were not covered by the script.

From an effectiveness perspective, Exploratory testing can find more defects than manual scripted testing because of the free nature of the exploration, but it does not cover all the test cases. Scripted testing may cover all the test cases but may miss the defects that are not covered by the script.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Two pairs were made from the group and for the scripted testing one pair did test case #1 to test case #20 and the other group 
did test case # 21 to test case # 40. The lab report was divided equally among the members of the team.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The lab guideline was easy to follow on the steps on how to do the testing, there were some questions for the rubric for the report, so the rubric should be more thorough. For next time maybe a schedule could be put for when each group will present so that it is more organized for everyone present. For next time we would also like maybe a number or an idea of how many errors we could encounter, just to test if we have done every step correctly.
